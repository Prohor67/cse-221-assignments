# 🚀 Algorithms & Text Processing in Python

This repository is a curated collection of Python scripts where I implemented **core algorithms** and **text processing techniques**. It includes everything from classic sorting and searching methods to advanced graph algorithms like **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and **Huffman Encoding**.

If you're preparing for coding interviews, contests, or just mastering the foundations of algorithmic thinking — you're in the right place.
